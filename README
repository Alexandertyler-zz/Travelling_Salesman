Usage: 
	python tsp.py <number of tests you want to run sequentially>

Note:
	answer.out is overwritten between runs. If you want to save a 
	copy of one either do it by hand or I can write a duplicaiton 
	logging script.

Visualization:
	city_graph is an array of each city. Each city is the index
	and the elements of each index are the distances from that
	city to all others. I think we should build a class instead
	of just an array and make each city have an attribute that
	is it's color and if its in a path already.
